But, we can imagine that if more years pass with the same present-day climate, there would be different but similar minimum temperatures in future March days.

Treating actual observations of natural events as if they were each *randomly* sampled from some unknown distribution is a simplifying assumption. These temperatures were not actually sampled at randomâ€”instead they occurred due to the complex interactions of the Earth's climateâ€”but treating them as if they were random abstracts away the details of this naturally occuring process and allows us to carry out statistical inference.  Conclusions are only as valid as the assumptions upon which they rest, but in this case thinking of daily temperatures as random samples from some unknown climate distribution seems at least plausible.\n",

In all months, the sample average we will consider (i.e. the `Present` value in our `monthly_differences` table) is higher than the historical average. As a result, we know in advance that the upper bound of the confidence interval will be higher as well, and there is no need to compute the upper bound explicitly. (But you can if you wish!)"
