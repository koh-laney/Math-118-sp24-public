    "## 1. What is the Pepsi Challenge\n",
    "The Pepsi Challenge was a direct marketing campaign by PepsiCo to compare the taste of Pepsi to that of its main competitor, Coca-Cola. In a blind taste test, participants were asked to sample two different cola drinks without knowing the brands and then select which one they preferred. The challenge's premise was simple yet effective: if a majority of participants preferred Pepsi over Coca-Cola in a blind taste test, it would suggest that Pepsi's taste was superior, challenging public perceptions and brand loyalty based on taste alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Origins of the Pepsi Challenge\n",
    "[The Pepsi Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Challenge)  first began in the 1970s as part of PepsiCo's aggressive marketing strategy to compete against Coca-Cola, the market leader. By conducting public blind taste tests, Pepsi aimed to demonstrate that consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi to Coca-Cola, thus encouraging people to rethink their cola preferences based on the taste rather than brand reputation or loyalty.\n"

She found 200 sworn Coca-Cola fans for our experiment. Participants were given two samples of cola, one of Pepsi and one of Coca-Cola, without any branding or identification. They then were asked to identify which one was Pepsi and which one was Coca-Cola. If a participant was truly a Coca-Cola fan, it would be expected that they could correctly identify the Coca-Cola sample.\n",

Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct cola is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, weâ€™ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.
