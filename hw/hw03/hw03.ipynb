    "Flint, Michigan is a city about an hour outside Detroit. In 2014, Flint, Michigan switched its drinking water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving move.  In September 2015 a Flint pediatrician found: The incidence of elevated blood-lead levels in children citywide had nearly doubled since 2014—and nearly tripled in certain neighborhoods. In 2015, an independent group of researchers at Virginia Tech, volunteered to conduct a study into the water crisis. They collected Water samples from resident homes throughout the city and measured the lead levels. Below we load a table containing water samples collected from 272 homes from the [Flint Water Study](https://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/complete-dataset-lead-results-in-tap-water-for-271-flint-samples/). \n",
